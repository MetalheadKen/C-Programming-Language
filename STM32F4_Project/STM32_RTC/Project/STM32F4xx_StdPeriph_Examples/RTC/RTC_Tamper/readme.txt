@par Example Description 

  This example shows how to write/read data to/from RTC Backup data registers and 
  demonstrates the Tamper detection feature.

  One from the following clock can be used as RTC clock source (uncomment the
  corresponding define in main.c):
   - LSE oscillator clock usually delivered by a 32.768 kHz quartz.
   - LSI oscillator clock

  The associated firmware performs the following:
  
  1. It configures the RTC_AF1 pin Tamper to be falling edge, and enables the Tamper 
     interrupt.
     
  2. It writes the data to all RTC Backup data registers, then check whether the 
     data were correctly written. If yes, LED1 turns on, otherwise LED3 turns on.
     
  3. When applying a low level on the RTC_AF1 pin (PC.13), the RTC backup data registers
     are reset and the Tamper interrupt is generated. The corresponding ISR then checks
     whether the RTC Backup data registers are cleared or not. If yes LED2 turns ON,
     otherwise LED4 turns ON.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board. 

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use the TAMPER push button connected to PC.13 pin (EXTI Line13).
      
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
