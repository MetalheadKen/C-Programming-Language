@par Example Description 

  This example illustrates how to use the STM32F4xx new RTC's sub-seconds and
  Tamper feature (Filter, sampling) features. It simulates a precise chronometer
  with 10 record times possibilities stored in the Backup registers (10 registers
  for time (second, minutes and hours) and 10 registers for subsecond).
  
  For this example an interactive human interface is developed using STM324xx EVAL’s 
  LCD and Push Buttons to allow user to use StopWatch with real time display.

  After startup, a default chronometer counter format "00:00:00:000" is displayed 
  on the LCD, it corresponds to [Hours]:[minutes]:[seconds]:[milliseconds].
  User can manipulate the chronometer features using the Tamper and Wakeup buttons:
    - press Wakeup button to start counter.
    - press Tamper button to save trials in the backup registers (max 10 actions).

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board. 

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use Wakeup pash button. 
    - Use the TAMPER push button connected to PC.13 pin (EXTI Line13).
 
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
