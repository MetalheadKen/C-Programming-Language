@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral in Output Compare Timing 
mode with the corresponding Interrupt requests for each channel in order to generate
4 different time bases.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock / 2 (Hz), to get TIM3 counter 
clock at 6 MHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1

SystemCoreClock is set to 168MHz for STM32F4xx Devices.

The TIM3 CC1 register value is equal to 40961, 
CC1 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR1_Val = 146.48 Hz,
so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates an interrupt each 6.8ms

The TIM3 CC2 register is equal to 27309, 
CC2 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR2_Val = 219.7 Hz
so the TIM3 Channel 2 generates an interrupt each 4.55ms

The TIM3 CC3 register is equal to 13654, 
CC3 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR3_Val = 439.4Hz
so the TIM3 Channel 3 generates an interrupt each 2.27ms

The TIM3 CC4 register is equal to 6826, 
CC4 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR4_Val =  878.9 Hz
so the TIM3 Channel 4 generates an interrupt each 1.13ms.

When the counter value reaches the Output compare registers values, the Output 
Compare interrupts are generated and, in the handler routine, 4 pins(PG.06, PG.08,
PI.09 and PC.07) are toggled with the following frequencies: 

- PG.06: 73.24Hz (CC1)
- PG.08: 109.8Hz (CC2)
- PI.09: 219.7Hz (CC3) 
- PC.07: 439.4Hz (CC4)

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/41xx and STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL(STM32F40xx/41xx Devices) 
    and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/437x Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up  
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08, PI.09
      and PC.07 pins and connect them on an oscilloscope to show the different 
      Time Base signals.
