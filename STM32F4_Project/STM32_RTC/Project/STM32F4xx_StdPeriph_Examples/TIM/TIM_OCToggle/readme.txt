@par Example Description 

  This example shows how to configure the TIM3 peripheral to generate four different 
  signals with four different frequencies.

  The TIM3CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock / 2 (Hz), and we want to get TIM3
  counter clock at 21 MHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
    - Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
  SystemCoreClock is set to 168 MHz for STM32F4xx devices

  The TIM3 CCR1 register value is equal to 40961: 
  CC1 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR1_Val = 512.68 Hz,
  so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 256.35 Hz.

  The TIM3 CCR2 register is equal to 20480:
  CC2 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR2_Val = 1025.39 Hz
  so the TIM3 channel 2 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 512.7 Hz.

  The TIM3 CCR3 register is equal to 10240:
  CC3 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR3_Val = 2050.8 Hz
  so the TIM3 channel 3 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 1025.4 Hz.

  The TIM3 CCR4 register is equal to 5120:
  CC4 update rate = TIM3 counter clock / CCR4_Val =  4101.56 Hz
  so the TIM3 channel 4 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 2050.78 Hz.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.
        
  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the TIM3 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
       - PC.06 (TIM3_CH1)
       - PC.07 (TIM3_CH2)
       - PC.08 (TIM3_CH3)
       - PC.09 (TIM3_CH4) 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
