@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the ADC peripheral to
convert regular channels simultaneously in dual mode using DMA in mode 1.

Regular simultaneous mode is performed on a regular group of channels. 
In Dual ADC mode, ADC1 data are transferred on the first request, ADC2 data are
transferred on the second request and so on.
On each DMA request (one data item is available), a half-word representing an
ADC-converted data item is transferred.
The conversion is triggered by software.

The ADC1 is configured to convert ADC Channel 10 and 11.
The ADC2 is configured to convert ADC Channel 11 and 12.

Note: the sequence length must be the same for both ADCs

In this example, the system clock is 168MHz, APB2 =84MHz and ADC clock = APB2 /2.
So ADCCLK= 42MHz 

Conversion rate of channel 10 and 12 = 30 cycles => Conversion Time = 42M/30cyc = 1.4Msps.
Conversion rate of channel 11 = 15 cycles => Conversion Time = 42M/15cyc = 2.8Msps.

@note Refer to "simulation.xls" file to have the diagram simulation of the example.

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL and STM32437I-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect PC.0, PC.1 and PC.2 to a power supply (do not forget to connect the
      power supply GND to the EVAL board GND)


@par How to use it ?
