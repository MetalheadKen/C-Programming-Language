@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM9 peripheral to generate four different 
signals with Two different frequencies.

The TIM9CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), and we want to get TIM9
counter clock at 15 MHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM9CLK / TIM9 counter clock) - 1
   
SystemCoreClock is set to 168 MHz for STM32F4xx devices

The TIM9 CCR1 register value is equal to 40961: 
CC1 update rate = TIM9 counter clock / CCR1_Val = 366.2 Hz,
so the TIM9 Channel 1 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 183.1 Hz.

The TIM9 CCR2 register is equal to 20480:
CC2 update rate = TIM9 counter clock / CCR2_Val = 732.4 Hz
so the TIM9 channel 2 generates a periodic signal with a frequency equal to 366.3 Hz.

@note The "system_stm32f4xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F4xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.1.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3988 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a> 

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/41xx and STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL(STM32F40xx/41xx Devices) 
    and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/437x Devices) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored 
    to any other supported device and development board

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the TIM9 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
       - PA.02 (TIM9_CH1)
       - PA.03 (TIM9_CH2)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
