@par Example Description 

This example provides a small application in which joystick buttons are used 
to trigger USART communication using interrupts and though using USART firmware 
library.

- Hardware Description

To use this example, you need to load it on two STM32 boards (let's call them 
BoardA and BoardB) then connect these two boards through UART lines and GND.

@note
- The connection between the pins should use a common Ground.

- Software Description

At Tamper button press, the USART Transmitter Board sends the TxBuffer to 
the USART Receiver Board

  Received data correctness is signaled by LED lightening and though as follow:
 - LED2 is ON when the comparison result between source buffer and destination 
   buffer is passed otherwise LED3 is ON.
  
The steps described above can be also initiated and ensured by BoardB. 

In both boards(BoardA or BoardB), the data transfers is managed using USARTx_IRQHandler 
in stm32f4xx_it.c file.

The SysTick is configured to generate interrupt each 10ms. A dedicated counter 
inside the SysTick ISR is used to toggle the LD1 each 100ms indicating that the 
firmware is running.
These operations can be repeated infinitely.

@par Hardware and Software environment

@par Hardware and Software environment  
  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL and STM32437I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use LED1, LED2 and LED3 connected respectively to PG.06, PG.08 and 
      PI.09 pins
    - Use the Tamper button 
    - Connect BoardA USART3 TX pin (PC.10) to BoardB USART3 RX pin (PC.11)
    - Connect BoardA USART3 RX pin (PC.11) to BoardB USART3 TX pin (PC.10)
