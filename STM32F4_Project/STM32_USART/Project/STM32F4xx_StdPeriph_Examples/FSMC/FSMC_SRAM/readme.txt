@par Example Description 

  This example shows how to configure the FSMC to drive the SRAM memory mounted 
  on STM3240_41_G_EVAL or STM32437I_EVAL boards. It uses an associate driver 
  developed to interface with the indicated SRAM device.
 
  After initializing the device, user can perform read/write operations on it. 
  A data buffer is written to the SRAM memory, then read back and checked to verify 
  its correctness.
  
  If the data is read correctly from SRAM, the LED1 is on, otherwise the LED2 is on.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F40xx/STM32F41xx, STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL (STM32F40xx/
    STM32F41xx Devices) and STM32437I-EVAL (STM32F427x/STM32F437x Devices) evaluation 
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development 
    board.

@par How to use it ? 

 In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Add the following file in the project source list:
   - STM324xG_EVAL: 
     Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324xG_EVAL\stm324xg_eval_fsmc_sram.c
           
   - STM324x7I_EVAL: 
     Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM324x7I_EVAL\stm324x7i_eval_fsmc_sram.c
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
