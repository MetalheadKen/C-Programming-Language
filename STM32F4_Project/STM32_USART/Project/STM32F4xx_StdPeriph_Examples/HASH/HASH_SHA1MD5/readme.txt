@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the HASH peripheral to 
hash data using SHA-1 and MD5 Algorithms.

For this example, no DMA is used for data transfer.

The SHA-1 message digest result is a 160 bit data and the MD5 message digest result 
is a 128 bit data.

The SHA-1 and MD5 digests can be displayed on a PC HyperTerminal using the USART.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs only on STM32F41xx/STM32F437x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL and STM32437I-EVAL 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN16 (USART3) and PC serial port.
      @note Make sure that jumper JP22 is in position 1-2
  
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
