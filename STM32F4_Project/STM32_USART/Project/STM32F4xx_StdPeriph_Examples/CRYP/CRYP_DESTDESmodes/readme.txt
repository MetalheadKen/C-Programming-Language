@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the CRYPTO peripheral to 
encrypt and decrypt data using DES and TDES in all modes (ECB, CBC) Algorithm.

For this example, a firmware is used to interface with the Crypto peripheral 
in polling mode.

This example is behaves as follow:
1. DES
  - DES ECB Encryption
  - DES ECB Decryption
  - DES CBC Encryption
  - DES CBC Decryption
2. TDES
  - TDES ECB Encryption
  - TDES ECB Decryption
  - TDES CBC Encryption
  - TDES CBC Decryption

The Plain data, encrypted data and decrypted data can be displayed on a PC 
HyperTerminal using the USART.

The USARTx is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs only on STM32F41xx/STM32F437x Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL and STM32437I-EVAL 
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - STM324xG-EVAL/STM32437I-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN16 (USART3) and PC serial port.
      @note Make sure that jumper JP22 is in position 1-2

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F4xx_StdPeriph_Templates
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
